          comment_body: |
            Thank you for your pull request to `rcbops/releases`!

            Once all required `check` jobs, prefixed with `check/`, have passed and the pull
            request has received a sufficient number of reviews, the repository's `release` job
            can be triggered by adding a comment of `:shipit:` to this pull request.

            If the requested release has one or more failing project tests and there are valid
            reasons to ignore the failure(s), a release can be forced through by triggering the
            process with a comment of `:shipit: skip validation`. This option should only be used
            in exceptional circumstances. The first course of action should always be to fix the
            failing job(s).

            If a release artifact already exists but is incorrect (eg tag pointing at the wrong SHA)
            then a release can be performed using `:shipit: re release`. This will cause existing
            tags and releases to be deleted and recreated if they don't match the current release.

            When the `release` job has completed successfully the release will have been created
            and this pull request will get merged automatically.
